      What is a browser cache and why clearing your cookies matters?
    </h1>
    <p>
      A browser cache is a place on your hard disk where things are downloaded to on the first time you load them in case they are needed again. Basically, it is a local space where
      data from sites are stored so they do not have to be downloaded time and time again. Cookies are similar but they are often used for the website so they can offer a more efficient and
      streamlined experience for the user after returning to their site. The reason we clear our cookies in order to have the MailChimp form reappear is that when you first load the form, the site
      will store data saying you have already filled (or not filled) the form out previously. This means the next time you enter the site the form will not reappear. By clearing the cookies this will
      no longer tell the website that you have filled this form out already, and so the site will once again pop up the form for you to annoyingly fill in once more.
